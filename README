# Calculator

A command line calculator (work-in-progress).
Features include:
- Variables
- Functions
- Matrices

# Syntax

Operators include `a + b`, `a - b`, `a * b`, `a / b`, `a ^ b`, `-a`, and `a!`.
Call functions with parentheses, such as `sqrt(2)` or `root(3, 27)`.
Create a matrix with `[1, 2; 3, 4]` where `,` indicates the next column and `;` indicates the next row.
Find the determinant with `det(m)` (only works with 2x2 for now).

Declare variables using `let name = expression`.
Declare functions using `let name(a, b, c) = expression`.

See grammar.bnf for exact details.

Run commands using `:command`, for example, `:help` or `:quit`.
